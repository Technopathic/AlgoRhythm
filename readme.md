# AlgoRhythm

AlgoRhythm is a mobile game for Android and iOS built with Unity3D and C#. AR currently supports three instruments, Guitar, Bass, and Piano. The game presents the player with the sound and waveform of a randomly selected note or chord. The player then decides which note matches the randomly selected note.
